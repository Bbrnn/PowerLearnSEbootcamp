"""
ðŸ”¹ Challenge: Create a program that reads a text file, processes its content, and writes the results to a new file.

ðŸ“Œ Task Requirements:
Create a file called input.txt and write at least five lines of text into it.
Write a Python script to:
Read the contents of input.txt.
Count the number of words in the file.
Convert all text to uppercase.
Write the processed text and the word count to a new file called output.txt.
Print a success message once the new file is created.
